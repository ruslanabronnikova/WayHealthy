        <p class="text-m mt-3">Pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
          teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,
          or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
          rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
          or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
          toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
          laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
          a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
          produces no resultant pleasure?
